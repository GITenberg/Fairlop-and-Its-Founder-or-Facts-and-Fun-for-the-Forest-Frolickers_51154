<h2><a name="page1"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1</span>The
History and Origin of Fairlop Fair, with Memoirs of Mr. Daniel
Day, the Founder, &amp;c.</h2>
<p>THIS curious and interesting account, written by a gentleman
of Essex, intimate with one of the descendants of Mr. Daniel Day,
will afford us an instance of its being in the power of almost
every man, to add to the felicity of his neighbours and fellow
creatures.&nbsp; The subject before us, though in the middling
rank of life, for a series of years had the gratification to see
the hearts of hundreds annually rejoiced and made glad, by his
means, around the old Oak, and thousands to this time assemble
there, on the day he set apart for innocent pastime and rational
recreation, so that the benevolent views of his heart were not
buried with him in his grave: and, we most sincerely hope, while
the spot whereon stood the far-famed Fairlop Oak is to be pointed
out, the sons and daughters of freedom and hilarity will meet
beneath the delightful shades of the Forest of Hainault, in
commemoration of the Founder of the Feast and Fair, Daniel
Day.</p>
<p>Daniel Day was born in the parish of St. Mary Overy, (in which
parish his father was an opulent brewer) in the year 1683, and
for a great number of years, until his death, was a very
considerable engine, pump, and blockmaker, in the parish of St.
John&rsquo;s, Wapping, where, to this day, his memory is
respected as a great benefactor to that parish, particularly in
the gift of the great bell at the consecration of the new church
in 1760, and as an upright and ingenious tradesman, a great
mechanic, as the many inventions he has left behind him in the
construction of various descriptions of engines and pumps, and of
the improvement he made in the jiggers used by brewers in the
starting of beer, which is worked by them to this day,
sufficiently proves.&nbsp; He was of a most charitable <a
name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>and humane
temper, and exemplarily generous and liberal in his principles
and actions; to evince this we need only mention his portioning
off his twin nieces in his life-time with &pound;1000 each, one
of whom lies buried near him.&nbsp; He would not only lend a
distressed friend considerable sums, but he invariably refused
the smallest interest, and very frequently forgave the principal;
in short, his character for probity was such, that his neighbours
were ever satisfied with his arbitrations in their disputes, to
which his abilities were amply adequate; his memory was
astonishingly retentive, in so great a degree, as to enable him
to repeat, almost verbatim, a long discourse or sermon.&nbsp; He
was not the enemy of any man, or particular description of men,
but the muscles of his face were violently agitated whenever he
heard of litigation in law, and he always professed to be uneasy
in the company of the practitioners of it.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the very large sums he distributed in
charities and lent, he lived in comfort and died rich, leaving to
the eight fatherless children of his niece, whom we have already
alluded to, the bulk of his property to be equally divided.</p>
<p>It is with some degree of pain we mention that Mr. Day was
never married, because with a heart replete with the milk of
human kindness, and possessing an understanding at the same time
solid and elevated, he wanted only the additional great
characters of a husband and father to have made him more
completely the great and good man.</p>
<p>Mr. Day had many eccentricities, but they were unoffending in
their nature, and no man was ever splashed or injured by his
hobby-horse.&nbsp; We should be doing injustice to his memory if
we did not mention a peculiar and very high trait in his
character, and that was, his kindness to his servants; in a few
words, he was their friend.&nbsp; He had a widowed house-keeper
who lived with him for thirty years, and died in his life-time at
a very advanced age.&nbsp; She <a name="page3"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 3</span>had two very strong attachments, one
to her wedding-ring and garments, and the other to tea; when she
died, Mr. Day would not permit her ring to be taken off&mdash;he
said, &ldquo;If that was attempted, she would come to life
again,&rdquo; and directed that she should be buried in her
wedding suit, and a pound of tea in each hand; and these
directions were literally obeyed.</p>
<p>This whim was highly illustrative of his good nature, for
although he had an aversion to tea, and never drank it, he did
not debar his servants the use of it; and in the instance of his
old house-keeper, carried his liberality even into her grave, by
providing her a commodity there, which she was so fond of
here.&nbsp; And although a bachelor, no man honoured more the
marriage state, as will be seen hereafter.</p>
<p>Mr. Day enjoyed as much as any man his friend and pitcher, but
he was temperate and regular in his mode of living, and very fond
of the exercise of walking; by this means he enjoyed an uncommon
share of health, until his death.</p>
<p>We are now drawing towards that last scene which sooner or
later must happen to the mighty and the weak, the rich and the
poor, the good and the bad.</p>
<p>A few years before Mr. Day&rsquo;s death, a branch of the Old
Oak received a shock, either by decay, by lightning, or storm;
this operated upon Mr. Day as the warning of an old
friend&mdash;it pointed out to him the instability of life, and
the effects of time; and he received the call with the
resignation of a christian, and the fortitude of a man, who was
conscious of having performed his allotted part with
propriety.</p>
<p>He set about with alacrity, a task which to some men would
have been an awful preparation for the journey: his first
business was to provide the repository; by the favour of the lord
of the manor, he procured the dismembered limb of his favourite
tree: this being done, he employed a Mr. Clear, a carpenter, to
measure him for a coffin, and to make it out <a
name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>of this
oak.&nbsp; Mr. Clear executed his job, and brought home his work,
which was neatly pannelled, and highly rubbed and varnished with
bees-wax.&nbsp; Mr. Day viewed his future habitation with the
utmost serenity and philosophy, and addressing himself to the
carpenter, said, &ldquo;Mr. Clear, I have heard that when a
person dies he is much stretched, and consequently much longer
than when living,&rdquo; and, punning upon the man&rsquo;s name,
went on, &ldquo;now, Mr. Clear, it is not very <span
class="GutSmall">CLEAR</span> to me that you have made this
coffin long enough, but, however, we&rsquo;ll try;&rdquo; and
laying himself down in the coffin, he found it too short.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Never mind it,&rdquo; says the Stoic, &ldquo;you must
desire my executors to cut off my head and put it between my
legs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His next care was the disposition of his estate, and in this
instance, as well as in every action of his life, he demonstrated
himself to be a just and honest man.</p>
<p>After bequeathing several legacies, and providing for the
children of his niece, as we have before observed, he carried his
harmless oddities to the last action possible, and in that his
mind shone with its wonted benignity.&nbsp; He directed his
executors to convey his remains, by water, to Barking,
accompanied by six journeymen pump and block-makers, as bearers;
to each of whom he gave a new white leather apron and a
guinea.</p>
<p>There is a proof of his munificence that ought not to be
omitted; it was his custom, upon the birth of all his
niece&rsquo;s children, to present the mother with a gold coral,
a pap-boat, and a purse of 50 guineas.&nbsp; I appeal to those of
my fair country-women who are mothers, whether such a gallant
present would not be very pleasing to them upon such occasions;
and I cannot dismiss this account without observing, that the
poor were daily fed at his door, and never craved other relief
from him in vain.</p>
<p>Mr. Day was not one of those persons who left the grand
account to be balanced at the hour of dissolution, <a
name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>or who have to
trust only to a sick-bed repentance for the errors of their whole
lives: he was a protestant, and a constant attendant upon divine
worship at his parish church, and though he had no child of his
own, he would always enforce the attendance of his nephews and
nieces, their children, and of his servants.</p>
<p>Mr. Day was not without his aversions, which were generally
well founded and immoveable, but he had few resentments.</p>
<p>In his dress and manners he was simplicity itself, and he was
an amateur of music and dancing, the meetings of which he
frequently attended; upon one of these occasions he was invited
to a superior circle, where he was told it would be necessary to
wear ruffles, and a pair of the finest point lace was presented
to him; he viewed them with some degree of contempt, and said,
&ldquo;If it was the custom he must comply, but it should be in
his own way,&rdquo; and directed his house-keeper to get the lace
dyed green, in which colour he wore them at that assembly, and
upon all similar occasions.</p>
<p>Mr. Day retained his health until within a day or two of his
death, and his faculties to the last.&nbsp; As he had lived, so
he died&mdash;a devout christian, a sincere friend, a good
master, and an honest man; he was just without austerity, liberal
without profuseness, free without intemperance, and lively
without excess; in fine, he lived merry and wise, and died
universally revered and lamented on the 19th of October, 1767, in
the 84th year of his age, and was buried agreeable to his Will,
in his oak coffin, in the churchyard at Barking, in Essex, where
the following epitaph may be seen:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Here lieth interr&rsquo;d the Body of Mr. D<span
class="smcap">aniel </span>D<span class="smcap">ay</span>, Block
and Pump Maker, late of the Parish of St. John&rsquo;s Wapping;
who departed this Life October the 19th 1767, Aged 84 years.</p>
<p>Death, from this world, hath set me free<br />
From all my pain and misery.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>On the
reverse side of the stone appears the following:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>As a respectful tribute to the memory of the
Founder of Fairlop Fair, the Company of Block Makers caused this
stone to be repaired A.D. 1829, under the direction of the
following members:&mdash;Joseph Flowers, William James Grinyer,
Thomas Hemingway, Abraham Kimm, William Row, and John Owen,
Treasurer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Close to his grave is a brick tomb, with an inscription to the
memory of his sister, Mrs. Sarah Killick, who died the 22d of
August, 1782, in the 93d year of her age.&nbsp; A woman
remarkable for the beauty of her person, sweetness of
disposition, and the share of health she also enjoyed through
life.&nbsp; Till her death she could play at cards, and read and
work, without spectacles.</p>
<p>Having thus briefly introduced to the reader, an outline of
the character of Mr. Daniel Day, who in the latter part of his
life was called &ldquo;Old Daniel Day,&rdquo; we will proceed to
say a few words of his favourite Oak.&mdash;This venerable and
stupendous tree stood in Hainault Forest, about 10 miles from
London, 3 from Ilford, and 2 from the village of Chigwell, in
Essex.&nbsp; The trunk, or main stem, of this giant of the forest
measured, about a yard from the ground, 36 feet in
circumference!&nbsp; From this issued 11 vast arms, each of the
dimensions of a tree of moderate growth.&nbsp; In the meridian of
the day, about 60 years ago, it is said that its shadow extended
over nearly an acre of ground!&nbsp; This tree was, about the
year 1800, fenced round with a close paling, above five feet
high, almost all the extremities of its branches sawed off, and
Mr. Forsyth&rsquo;s composition applied to them, to preserve them
from decay; and the injury which the trunk of the tree had
sustained from the lighting of fires in the cavities, was
repaired, as much as possible, by the same composition.&nbsp; At
the same time, on one of the branches, was fixed a board, with
this inscription: &ldquo;All good Foresters are requested not to
hurt this old Tree, a plaster having been lately applied to its
wounds.&rdquo;&nbsp; The rabble, however, regardless <a
name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>of the respect
due to the veteran of the Forest, soon broke down the paling,
lighted fires within the trunk, as heretofore, and in
consequence, before long, several of the limbs were broken quite
off.</p>
<p>On the 25th of June, 1805, this famous Oak was discovered to
be on fire, occasioned by a party of sixty persons, who came from
London in several carriages during the morning, and amused
themselves through the day with playing at cricket and other
sports; they had kindled a fire, which had spread very
considerably after they left the spot, but it was not discovered
for two hours.&nbsp; A number of persons came with water to
extinguish the flames, which was not effected until the main
branch on the south side, with part of the body, was
consumed.</p>
<p>The high winds of February 1820, however, stretched its massy
trunk and limbs on that turf which it had for so many ages
overshadowed with its verdant foliage; and thus it exhibited a
melancholy memento of the irresistable power of time in bringing
to an end not only the flower of a season, but also the towering
growth of many ages.</p>
<p>The remains of the Fairlop Oak were purchased by Mr.
Seabrooke, the builder of St. Pancras Church, and both the
magnificent pulpits of that church were formed out of it, and
they are certainly the most beautiful of their kind to be met
with.</p>
<p>Our friend Mr. Day&mdash;for the friend of mankind never
dies&mdash;had a small estate, whether hereditary, or a purchase,
we do not know, near the Fairlop Oak, and thither he annually
resorted, about a fortnight after Midsummer, to receive his
rents; the congeniality of his temper would not suffer him to
receive the good things of this world alone, and it was his
custom to invite a few of his neighbours to accompany him, and
there he would treat them with a repast of beans and bacon,
&amp;c. under the canopy of the Oak, the accomodations being
provided from an adjacent small public-house, the Maypole.&nbsp;
Mr. Day&rsquo;s <a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>friends were so well pleased with the rural novelty, that
they one and all pledged themselves to accompany him on the same
occasion every year, on the first Friday in July, during their
lives.</p>
<p>In the course of a few years, this amicable meeting greatly
increased, and became known to the neighbouring gentry, farmers,
and yeomanry; and a vast number of them annually, on the day of
Mr. Day&rsquo;s jubilee, visited the place.&nbsp; Suttling booths
were soon found to be necessary for their accommodation, which
naturally produced various other booths for sale, arranged around
the huge Oak; and about the year 1725, this charming spot began
to present every resemblance of a regular fair.&nbsp; It
progressively increasing, puppet-shows, wild beasts, fruits,
gingerbread, ribbons, and toys, of all descriptions, attended
with the usual pastimes of a country wake, soon succeeded, and in
a very few years it became one of the most respectable,
well-regulated, and harmonious, fairs round the metropolis.&nbsp;
This new generation of Mr. Day&rsquo;s creation became his
principal hobby-horse, and he found himself highly flattered by
the honest attentions of his numerous visitors.</p>
<p>Suffer me here to digress for a few moments: methinks we see
the good old man indulging the graceful sensations resulting from
a knowledge of his having founded and promoted a meeting of
innocent conviviality, and receiving the smiling congratulations
of artless beauty, dancing around him and his venerable Tree,
with bosoms light and pure as the atmosphere above them.&nbsp;
Say, ye sons and daughters of dissipation, who indulge in
midnight revelry, are your pursuits equal to the simple joys of a
country fair?&nbsp; Is there no difference between the confined
and crowded play-house, or opera, where you are all gasping for a
little contaminated effluvia, and the healthful and fragrant
breezes of sylvan Fairlop?</p>
<p>See the ruddy glow of rosy health, so fascinatingly contrasted
with the lily&rsquo;s rival, and the natural ringlets <a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>flowing with
the playful wind!&nbsp; Behold the modest, yet delightful work of
nature!&nbsp; Is there no distinction between these simple
beauties, and the artful manufactured face, on which the
faithless rouge and poisonous white lay waste God&rsquo;s best of
works, and leave not a wreck behind?</p>
<p>But to return: the open and generous heart of Mr. Day expanded
with inexpressible delight at being the cause of happiness to
others, he thought some little return due to the lads and lasses,
who so graciously favoured him with their company; he provided
several sacks of beans, and a sufficient quantity of bacon,
dressed; the bacon was mixed in slices with the beans, and
distributed from the trunk of the Tree to the multitude in
pansful.&nbsp; The happy, frolicksome contest for the envied
portion, is more easily conceived than described.&nbsp;
Unfortunate was he who did not procure a share for his
fair-one.&nbsp; Blessings were the donor&rsquo;s reward, and the
air resounded with huzzas; the very leaves of the venerable Tree
nodded in silent and majestic gratitude: this custom he continued
to his death.&nbsp; How long the chosen companions of this
festival lived to accompany the founder, is not known.&nbsp; It
is not to be doubted but they individually kept their word.&nbsp;
Mr. Day survived them all, about ten in number, several
years.</p>
<p>In the former part of Mr. Day&rsquo;s life, he usually walked
to Fairlop and back again; later in life he was wont to ride on
horseback, but having a fall from his horse, he declared he would
never cross another; he kept his vow, sold his horse, and
purchased a mule: this obstinate animal also, unconscious of the
worth he bore, threw his rider in the mire.&nbsp; Mr. Day
discarded his mule as he had done his horse, and determined never
more to trust himself upon the back of a four-legged beast.&nbsp;
His next resource was a post-chaise or a coach; in one of these
he also met with an accident, and ever after refused to enter
into either.&nbsp; This last circumstance induced him to direct
his remains to be conveyed by water to the place of burial, <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>saying,
&ldquo;If he was conveyed in a hearse, he should be
awakened.&rdquo;&nbsp; He next invented a machine to go by the
aid of mechanical power without horses, which, after two years
successful trial, broke down in attempting the third
expedition.&nbsp; His dernier resort was a jockey-cart, in which,
attended by music, he took his annual trip up to the July
preceding his death.</p>
<p>Long previous to Mr. Day&rsquo;s exit, Fairlop Fair was known
all over Essex, and the adjoining counties; and naturally the
inhabitants of Wapping, and the eastern parts of London, could
not be ignorant of it, consequently it was attended by a vast
concourse of people.&nbsp; The engine-makers, pump-makers, and
block-makers of Wapping, and other places contiguous to the
river, a few years before Mr. Day&rsquo;s death, to the amount of
about thirty or forty, every year went to the Fair in a boat made
of one piece of entire fir, covered with an awning, mounted on a
coach-carriage, drawn by six horses, with flags, streamers, and
pendants flying, and a band of music, attended by a great many
persons on horseback, in carriages, and on foot.&nbsp; This
custom, on the first Friday in every July, has been successively
observed to this time, in compliment, and in commemoration of
their old friend and &ldquo;brother chip,&rdquo; to whose pious
memory they never fail to drink.&nbsp; The great annual resort to
Fairlop Fair is so well known for twenty miles around, that it is
needless to say more on the subject than that in point of the
number of persons who go to it, and in accomodations and articles
for sale, it is not inferior to any fair near the metropolis,
excepting that it is only of one day&rsquo;s duration.&nbsp;
Seven and twenty years have now elapsed since the famous Fairlop
Oak ceased to attract the attention of the holiday-makers, but
the mirth and festivity, gypsying, archery, donkey-riding,
swinging, &amp;c. are still to be witnessed to a great
extent.&nbsp; Long may Fairlop&rsquo;s Friday continue to be
joyously looked forward to by all as &ldquo;the good
Day&rsquo;s&rdquo; day of &ldquo;fun and jollity!&rdquo;</p>

13</span>FAIRLOPIAN POEMS AND SONGS</h2>
<h3>THE FAIR DAY OF FAIRLOP FAIR.<br />
JULY 3, 1846.</h3>
<p class="poetry">COME lovers of doggrel, come lovers of
sport,<br />
Haste here&mdash;at the bidding of Momus resort,<br />
And toss up your &ldquo;toppers&rdquo; ten feet in the air,<br />
Since we&rsquo;ve had a fair day for the Day of our Fair.</p>
<p class="poetry">Sure, Jove at our bidding fulfill&rsquo;d our
desire,<br />
And each rider, each walker, each seller, and buyer,<br />
Of pleasure and profit came in for their share,<br />
As they hail&rsquo;d the fair day, on the Day of the Fair.</p>
<p class="poetry">If the Satyrs and Fawns were unseen in the
dance,<br />
And the Dryads themselves look&rsquo;d a little askance,<br />
Yet the beaux and the belles throng&rsquo;d in many a pair,<br />
Nor thought of an absence from Fairlop the Fair.</p>
<p
class="poetry">Pedestrians&mdash;equestrians&mdash;vehiculars&mdash;all<br
/>
Of splendor or merriment kept up the ball;<br />
And Venus herself, or else some to compare,<br />
Adorn&rsquo;d the fair day, and the Day of the Fair.</p>
<p class="poetry">How delightful the scene!&mdash;how great were
the joys<br />
Of the saunt&rsquo;rers, and simp&rsquo;rers, and venders of
toys;<br />
And the lov&rsquo;d and the lovely of each had their share,<br />
And enjoy&rsquo;d the fair day, and the Day of the Fair.</p>
<p class="poetry">Not more had there been of din, frolic, and
fun,<br />
Had Bacchus been present, bestriding his tun;<br />
And Mercury himself had his followers there,<br />
Who hail&rsquo;d the fair day, and the Day of the Fair.</p>
<p class="poetry">&rsquo;Tis certain at evening Diana
look&rsquo;d down,<br />
And eclipsed in a trice all the gas-lights in Town;<br />
Whilst our taverns, though brilliant, shone forth in despair,<br
/>
As the night drew her curtain of cloud round the Fair.</p>
<p class="poetry">Then, lovers of doggrel, and lovers of
sport,<br />
Next year at the bidding of Momus resort;<br />
And Apollo himself shall in future repair,<br />
And still give a fair day for the Day of our Fair.</p>

14</span>INVITATION TO FAIRLOP FAIR.</h3>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="GutSmall">(REPRINTED
VERBATIM.)</span></p>
<p class="poetry">COME to Fairlop Fair; we good fellows
invite;<br />
So partake of that day, which is our delight;<br />
For we have spirits like fire; our courage is good;<br />
And we meet with the best of respect on the road;<br />
When you see us, you&rsquo;ll say we are mounted quite
gay;&mdash;<br />
Success to the lads, that delight in that day.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Haste away, haste away; all nature seems gay,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us drink to the joys of old Fairlop so gay!</p>
<p class="poetry">Our horses are all of the very best blood;<br
/>
Our boat is well built, and her rigging is good.<br />
With our boats and our badges we unanimous declare,<br />
And join hand in hand, to support the old Fair;<br />
We&rsquo;ll jovially sing, and our music shall play,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And a set of staunch ponies will tow us away.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Haste away, haste away, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="poetry">&rsquo;Twas one Daniel Day, that first founded
this Fair,<br />
And as hearty a fellow as ever was there;<br />
The Lord of the Manor a Charter did gain,<br />
And all true sons of Neptune will uphold the same;<br />
We&rsquo;ll enjoy all the pleasure that springs from that day,<br
/>
And ever remember good old Daniel Day.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Haste away, haste away, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="poetry">From Wapping Old Stairs, away then we drive,<br
/>
When the first Friday in July does arrive;<br />
We breakfast at Woodford; at Loughton we lunch,<br />
And at our old friend&rsquo;s house we&rsquo;ll dine and drink
punch;<br />
When our Boatswain will start us away for the Fair,<br />
While Phoebus does shine on our Colours so clear.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Haste away, haste away, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="poetry">It&rsquo;s when from the Forest to Ilford we
steer,<br />
Every town we go through, we will give them three Cheer!<br />
Then on our way home we will still get refreshed;<br />
Then return back to Wapping, to sup of the best;<br />
Where we&rsquo;ll dance and we&rsquo;ll sing so cheerful and
gay,<br />
And ever remember good old Daniel Day.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Haste away, haste away, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="poetry">Now having described our boat, horses, and
crew,<br />
And old Fairlop so gay, which you all may review,<br />
Our boat now comes home by the winding of caul;&mdash;<br />
And so you are welcome unto Fairlop Hall!&mdash;<br />
Our boat we&rsquo;ll put by for another Fair-day,<br />
And ever remember good old Daniel Day.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Haste away, haste away; all nature seems gay,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us drink to the joys of old Fairlop so gay!</p>

<p class="poetry">LADS, let us jovial float<br />
Merry in our tight-rigg&rsquo;d boat;<br />
Our Pilot so gay with badge and coat<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall tow us along:<br />
The music shall so sweetly play,<br />
And all shall be so blithe and gay;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll laugh and joke,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And drink and smoke,<br />
And join the cheerful song.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lads, let us,
&amp;c.</p>
<p class="poetry">On the first Friday after June,<br />
Like the birds, we&rsquo;re in full tune;<br />
We rise up in the morning soon,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Our neat boat to trim.<br />
From St. George&rsquo;s turnpike we do start,<br />
And with joy from home depart,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Music playing,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Colours flying,<br />
Then does the fun begin.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lads, let us,
&amp;c.</p>
<p class="poetry">Then first to Ilford we do steer,<br />
And, when we have had breakfast there,<br />
Then to Romford do repair;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From thence to Hornchurch go;<br />
Thence back again we go to dine,<br />
Where we booze on punch and wine,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Singing, dancing,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Life enhancing,<br />
For pleasure all on tip-toe.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lads, let us,
&amp;c.</p>
<p class="poetry">Then to Fairlop Fair we steer,<br />
With carriages in front and rear,<br />
Our skins quite brimful with good cheer;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So mellow then we start;<br />
Then we o&rsquo;er the Forest ride,<br />
Neither fearing wind nor tide,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Singing, laughing,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Drinking, quaffing,<br />
Merrily we glide.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lads, let us,

<p class="poetry">When Ph&oelig;bus to the west draws near,<br />
And the feather&rsquo;d race doth disappear,<br />
Then from the Forest we do steer,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; At Ilford awhile to stay;</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

Merry we&rsquo;re tow&rsquo;d along the road;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; All hearty, jovial,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Quite convivial,&mdash;<br />
Thus we finish the day.<br />

VERBATIM.)</span></p>
<p class="poetry">COME, come, my boys, with a hearty glee,<br />
To Fairlop Fair&mdash;bear chorus with me;<br />
At Hainault Forest, &rsquo;tis known very well,<br />
This famous Oak has long borne the bell.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let music sound, as the boat goes
round;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we tumble on the ground,
we&rsquo;ll be merry, I&rsquo;ll be bound,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will booze it away; dull care
we&rsquo;ll defy,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And be happy on the first Friday
in July.</p>
<p class="poetry">To Hainault Forest Queen Anne she did ride,<br
/>
And beheld the beautiful Oak by her side;<br />
And, after viewing it from the bottom to the top,<br />
She said to her Court, that it was <i>Fair-lop</i>!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is eight fathoms round, spreads
an acre of ground;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They plaster&rsquo;d it round, to
keep the Tree sound;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So we&rsquo;ll booze it away; dull
care we&rsquo;ll defy,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And be happy on the first Friday
in July.</p>
<p class="poetry">About a century ago, as I have heard say,<br />
This Fair it was kept by one Daniel Day,<br />
As hearty a good fellow as ever there could be;<br />
His coffin was made of a limb of the Tree.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="page18"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 18</span>With black-strap and sherry, he made
his friends merry,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All sorrows for to drown in
brandy, rum, and perry;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So they boozed it away; dull care
we will defy,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And be happy on the first Friday
in July.</p>
<p class="poetry">At Hainault old Forest there standeth a
tree,<br />
And round it have been dances, mirth, pranks, and glee;<br />
It is surrounded with woods, lawns, and plains,<br />
Where the merry little warblers pour forth their sweet
strains.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So we&rsquo;ll dance round the
Tree, and merry we will be;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every year we&rsquo;ll agree the
<i>fair</i> Fair for to see;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And we&rsquo;ll booze it away;

<h3>FAIRLOP FAIR.</h3>
<p style="text-align: center">AIR,&mdash;&ldquo;The
Maypole.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">BY JOHN LABERN.</p>
<p class="poetry">LAST Fairlop Fair&mdash;to drive away care,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; To toddle there we swore&mdash;<br />
There was ugly Bob, and Sam the snob,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And five and twenty more.<br />
Pat Murphy promised <i>Fair</i>,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So him we couldn&rsquo;t doubt&mdash;<br />
And what was pleasant, I declare,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Our mothers let us out.&nbsp; Tol lol, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="poetry">A cart and horse we hired, in course,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of Costermonger Joe&mdash;<br />
Who swore the nag was like a stag,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A regular good &rsquo;un to go.<br />
We took him at his word,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And paid a suvverin down,<br />
And away we toddled, toddled, toddled,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And hook&rsquo;d it out of town.&nbsp; Tol lol,
&amp;c.</p>
<p class="poetry">Sam wore whites, and Bob wore tights,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With a spicy long-tail&rsquo;d blue,<br />
While all the rest were up and drest<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In toggery &ldquo;petter as new.&rdquo;<br />
Besides, it was agreed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By Sam and ugly Bobby,<br />
A nosegay we should wear apiece,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To make us all look nobby.&nbsp; Tol lol,
&amp;c.</p>
<p class="poetry">Away we went, on pleasure bent,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As hard as we could trot&mdash;<br />
The horse look&rsquo;d bold, no wives did scold,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But the sun was werry hot.<br />
<a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>The
perspiration roll&rsquo;d,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The ladies&rsquo; colours run,<br />
Which clearly proved, and no mistake,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They&rsquo;d all been in the sun.&nbsp; Tol lol,
&amp;c.</p>
<p class="poetry">A treat, I&rsquo;m blow&rsquo;d, &rsquo;twas,
down the road,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To see him gallop hard,<br />
When all at once, the stupid dunce,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He wouldn&rsquo;t stir a yard.<br />
We give it him over the nob,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And whopp&rsquo;d him on the flank&mdash;<br />
But, lord! you might as well have tried<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To move the precious Bank.&nbsp; Tol lol,
&amp;c.</p>
<p class="poetry">The people laugh&rsquo;d, and jeer&rsquo;d and
chaff&rsquo;d,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As down the road they pass&rsquo;d&mdash;<br />
Though we were first, says Bob, I&rsquo;m cursed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; If we shan&rsquo;t be the last.<br />
We shoved away behind,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And so did Bob&rsquo;s fat mother&mdash;<br />
But as fast as we could shove one way,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The hunter shoved the other.&nbsp; Tol lol,
&amp;c.</p>
<p class="poetry">At last, cried Sam, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a
plan!&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Then a bunch of carrots ties<br />
To the end of a stick&mdash;an artful trick&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And fix&rsquo;d &rsquo;em afore his eyes.<br />
Away the hunter went<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With his precious livin&rsquo; load,<br />
When all at once the tail fell down,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And spilt us in the road.&nbsp; Tol lol, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="poetry">The women bawl&rsquo;d&mdash;the babbies
squall&rsquo;d,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We book&rsquo;d ourselves for dead&mdash;<br />
Some were hurt, and choked with dirt,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And some pitch&rsquo;d on their head.<br />
The grub got spoilt, on which<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Our hopes did so depend;<br />
And the goosegog pie had all got jamm&rsquo;d<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By Bobby&rsquo;s latter end.&nbsp; Tol lol,
&amp;c.</p>
<p class="poetry">By the time we&rsquo;d quite got o&rsquo;er our
fright,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The folks were coming back,&mdash;<br />
So we got done out of our fun,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Through the precious lazy hack.<br />
Next time we pleasuring went,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We swore with all our rage,<br />
If we couldn&rsquo;t get a better horse,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We&rsquo;d go by the Marrowbone stage.&nbsp; Tol
lol, &amp;c.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
